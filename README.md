Shevek is a free software iOS app for implementing David Allen's
Getting Things Done methodology.  It allows you to track inbox items,
projects, next actions, and waiting fors.

I haven't released the first version yet.  In the meantime, you can
build and install it yourself or [install it using
TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/eburEE5q).
